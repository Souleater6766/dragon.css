# dragon.css
Iâ€™ve made a dragon that follows the mouse mean while you hover on the web page


 
we've added a keyframe animation called "dragon-fly" to create a flying animation for the dragon. The animation lasts for 2 seconds, and loops infinitely. The transform property is used to move the dragon image across the screen and rotate it to create the flying effect.

In the dragon-fly animation, we're defining three keyframes. At the 0% keyframe, the dragon image is rotated 0 degrees and translated to the left of the screen. At the 50% keyframe, the dragon image is rotated 30 degrees and translated to the right of the screen. At the 100% keyframe, the dragon image is rotated 0 degrees and translated back to the left of the screen.

We've also added the animation property to the .dragon class to apply the dragon-fly animation to the dragon image.

When you add this extended CSS code to your HTML, you should see your dragon image appear on the screen, move towards the mouse when you hover over it, and fly across the screen in a looping animation.
